Business Problem Context
=====================================================

There are various HR systems in place across SteriPack Manufacturing & Design. This creates pain points and data gaps when managing basic HR processes (e.g., employee compensation and bonus), leading to teams having to manually consolidate and manipulate information in Excel from multiple sources and systems. This is not only time-consuming, but also raises issues around data privacy and integrity.

There is a need to quickly address these issues, by having one robust HRIS (HR Information System) and process in place by the end of the year, which will serve as a source of truth and enable the efficient management of basic HR processes for all group employees.

Solution Scope
=====================================================

The project aims to consolidate HR information into one system, including employee personal information and compensation details (e.g., bonuses) and enable stakeholders including HR Directors, Finance Directors, line / site managers, and employees to view and manage information easily.

This solution is not intended to replace existing local HR systems or manage direct labour tasks like shift scheduling.

While the solution will need to grow in terms of functionality, and eventually replace parts of existing systems, to its important the system as a good extensibility model.
